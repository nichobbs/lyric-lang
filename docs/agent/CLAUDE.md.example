# CLAUDE.md

## What this repo is

A Lyric application. Lyric is a safety-oriented language targeting .NET 10 (primary) and JVM (Java 21). Syntax is Kotlin/C#/TypeScript-adjacent. It is not TypeScript or Kotlin — read the docs before writing code.

## Build and run

```sh
lyric build          # compile (discovers lyric.toml from any subdir)
lyric run            # build + execute
lyric test           # run all @test_module files
lyric fmt --write    # format in place (opinionated, no config)
lyric lint           # style checks
lyric check          # type-check without emitting artifacts
lyric prove          # SMT verification on @proof_required packages
```

All commands discover `lyric.toml` by walking up from the working directory. No arguments needed from any subdir.

Source files use `.l` extension. Entry point is `func main(): Unit` in the appropriate package.

## Before writing any Lyric code

Read `docs/lyric/reference.md`. It covers syntax, type system semantics, and the things that look like TypeScript/Kotlin but aren't.

Read `docs/lyric/gotchas.md` before making assumptions.
