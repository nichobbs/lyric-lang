# Stdlib kernel

Per `docs/14-native-stdlib-plan.md` §3 and Decision F (D038), this
directory is the audited extern boundary for `Std.*`. Files here may
contain `@externTarget("System.X.Y")` and
`extern type T = "System.Foo"` declarations that bottom out at the
.NET BCL or other host runtime surfaces.

## What lives here

Every Lyric stdlib module that depends on a host operation that
cannot be expressed in pure Lyric — syscalls (file/network/console),
hardware-tuned BCL primitives (transcendentals, regex, JSON
tokenizer, TLS), threading primitives, IEEE 754 corner cases.
Anything else lives in the parent `compiler/lyric/std/` directory
as a native Lyric implementation.

## What does NOT live here

Native Lyric code. Pure-Lyric algorithms over `slice[T]`, primitives,
records, sum types, and other kernel modules belong in the parent
directory. If you find yourself writing `@externTarget` in a
non-kernel file, the convention is broken — move the declaration
here and `import` it from your safe-API module.

## Hard cap

Decision F sets a v1.0 release gate of **150 extern declarations
across the whole kernel**. Auditing 150 is tractable; auditing 500
is not. PRs that push the count toward the cap should justify each
new declaration in their description.

## Enforcement (the ratchet)

`compiler/tests/Lyric.Emitter.Tests/KernelBoundaryTests.fs` runs
on every CI build:

- **`extern declarations outside _kernel/ never grow`**: hard
  assertion. Any PR that adds `@externTarget`, `extern type`, or
  `extern package` outside `_kernel/` flips the test red. Migrate
  the declaration here instead.
- **`kernel total reported`**: today informational. Reports the
  combined extern surface; Decision F's hard cap of 150 becomes a
  blocking assertion at v1.0.

When a PR moves declarations into `_kernel/` (or rewrites them in
pure Lyric), it should also drop `outsideCeiling` in
`KernelBoundaryTests.fs` so the ratchet stays meaningful.

## Discovery

The build/test machinery (`Emitter.fs::locateStdlibFile`,
`Cli/Program.fs::locateStdlibFiles`,
`tests/Lyric.Emitter.Tests/StdlibSeedTests.fs::loadStdlibBody`)
recurses into this subdirectory. Top-level files shadow same-name
kernel files on collision so a future native rewrite of a kernel
module wins without manual cleanup.

## Documented exception

`compiler/lyric/std/collections.l` keeps its 5 extern declarations
(`extern type List[T]`, `extern type Map[K, V]`, plus the three
constructors and `tryGetValue`) at the top level instead of in
`_kernel/`. Migrating them requires either functioning `pub use`
re-exports for generic types, or full opaque wrapping of
`List[T]` / `Map[K, V]` — both blocked on M1.4 limitations
documented as `docs/06-open-questions.md` Q022. The ratchet
ceiling sits at 5 to encode this exception; closing Q022 lets
the ratchet drop to 0.
